# üìç Overview

Welcome to TypoVillain's interactive API documentation.

All of our Toolkit API services have <u>free tier support</u>, so getting started is an easy, worry-free experience.

If you haven't already, <a href="https://auth.typovillain.com/login?client_id=6gnt6nvgsk07jomm8ie538gkdt&response_type=code&scope=aws.cognito.signin.user.admin+email+openid&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.typovillain.com%2Foauth2%2Fcallback">sign up</a>. This will allow you to create a <b>"Project"</b> from your profile page. Once you have a project, you can use the Client "ID" and "Secret" associated with your project for authenticating with TypoVillain API services.

## Audience

This interactive API documentation is intended for software developers or cybersecurity engineers with basic to intermediate understandings of API's. For managers who are interested in business-value related content, our [About page](/about/intro) contains information about TypoVillain, domain monitoring, and end-to-end enterprise solutions describing <u>What</u> the TypoVillain Toolkit can do rather than the technical aspects around <u>How</u>.

## Examples

If you're the type of learner who prefers to jump into the deep end, there are plenty of examples on our [Tutorials page](/about/tutorials/intro). In fact, the tutorials page may be the best place to get a high-level understanding of TypoVillain API services and how each could help you design or enhance your own custom solutions. Then when you're ready to get into the specifics of each API, this set of documentation will be the place to do so.


## Services

| Tool      | Use-case   | Description |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| <b>certificate.stream</b>        | Certificate Transparency, Domain Monitoring | REST API for <u>polling</u> the Certificate Transparency Logs. There's no need to set up complex log streaming infrastructure, simply poll the certificate.stream API to get the latest certificates from any or all log operators such as Cloudflare, Google, or DigiCert.        |
| <b>harpoon.domains</b>           | Domain Monitoring, Alerting | REST API for <u>monitoring</u> the Certificate Transparency Logs. Simply, add a domain name that you want monitored and harpoon will use similarity metrics such as [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) to compare domains from the logs to your domain. If any similarity thresholds are met or exceeded, Harpoon will notify you.       |
| <b>swordphish.io</b>             | Web Scraping, Phish Detection, AI/ML Asset Monitoring | REST API for scraping and extracting website information such as HTML, HAR, WHOIS, DNS, TLS certificates, and Screenshots. Swordphish can be hooked into Harpoon's monitoring workflow to immediately scrape any suspicious domains and share the results with you in real-time.    |

<!-- 
The diagram below illustrates the relationships between Villain's API services. When used together these services are able to create a robust, end-to-end anti-phishing and domain monitoring workflows. However, each of these services is capable of acting entirely independent of one another. This allows the developer the freedom to pick and choose the API(s) that best fit their particular use-case without the need to completely redesign existing workflows.
