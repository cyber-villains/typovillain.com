# Introduction

Welcome to TypoVillain's Tutorials Page.

## Getting Started

A couple things before getting started ...

If you haven't already, <a href="https://auth.typovillain.com/login?client_id=6gnt6nvgsk07jomm8ie538gkdt&response_type=code&scope=aws.cognito.signin.user.admin+email+openid&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.typovillain.com%2Foauth2%2Fcallback">sign up</a>, confirm your email address, and create a "Project" so that your applications or scripts can [authenticate](/docs/introduction) and use TypoVillain's API services.

Many of these examples use Docker to maintain a consistent, self-contained build environment. Although not a hard requirement, it is encouraged to use Docker or another container management tool such as Podman for running these examples.

Python is our programming language of choice for these examples, if you're not a "Pythonista" please feel free to open an "Issue" on our [GitHub](https://github.com/cyber-villains/examples) requesting support for another language or open a Pull Request with your own code!

## Contributions Welcome!

All the source code for these examples can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/cyber-villains/examples). 

Please feel free to post questions under "Issues" or open a Pull Request with any edits or additions to these examples that you feel others may find useful.

Good luck!
