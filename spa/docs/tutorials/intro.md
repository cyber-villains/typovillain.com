# Introduction

Welcome to Villain's Tutorials Page.

## Getting Started

A couple things before getting started ...

If you haven't already, <a href="https://auth.villain.network/signup?client_id=4jj7baft9iisgeppfpblhpauiv&response_type=code&scope=aws.cognito.signin.user.admin+email+openid&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.villain.network%2Foauth2%2Fcallback">sign up</a>, confirm your email address, and create a "Project" so that you and your scripts can [Authenticate](/docs/introduction) with the APIs.

Many of these examples use Docker to maintain a consistent, self-contained build environment. Although not a requirement, it is encouraged to use Docker or another container management tool such as Podman for running these examples.

Python is our programming language of choice for these examples, if you're not a "Pythonista" please feel free to open an "Issue" on our [GitHub](https://github.com/cyber-villains/examples) requesting support for another language or open a Pull Request with your own code!

## Contributions Welcome!

All the source code for these examples can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/cyber-villains/examples). 

Please feel free to post questions under "Issues" or open a Pull Request with any edits or additions to these examples that you feel others may find useful.

Good luck!
