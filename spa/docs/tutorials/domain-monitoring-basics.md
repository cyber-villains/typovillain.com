# Domain Monitoring Basics

One of the best ways of preventing bad actors from spoofing your organization online, starts with Certificate Transparency Log monitoring. 

In this tutorial, you will utilize the certificate.stream API to pull domain names from the Certificate Transparency Logs, compare these domains to a domain that you want monitored, and alert if anything matches.

Create a file at `src/pages/my-react-page.js`:

```jsx title="src/pages/my-react-page.js"
import React from "react";
import Layout from "@theme/Layout";

export default function MyReactPage() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>My React page</h1>
      <p>This is a React page</p>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

A new page is now available at `http://localhost:3000/my-react-page`.

## Real-time Monitoring

Create a file at `src/pages/my-markdown-page.md`:

```mdx title="src/pages/my-markdown-page.md"
# My Markdown page

This is a Markdown page
```

A new page is now available at `http://localhost:3000/my-markdown-page`.
